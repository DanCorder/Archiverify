{"name":"Archiverify","tagline":"Archive synching and verification tool","body":"### What does it do?\r\nArchiverify takes two directories, recursively copies files between them, generates hashes for the files, and warns you if any existing files or hashes don't match.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nTo make back-ups of unchanging data simple and reliable.\r\n\r\nIf you have a large number of files that don't change - for example your digital photos - then Archiverify allows you to easily compare your master copy with your back-ups and copy over any new files. It will also warn you if either copy of a file gets corrupted.\r\n\r\n### But I back up to an online service\r\nThen feel free to move right along. As long as your online service guarantees your back-ups won't get corrupted then Archiverify isn't for you. Amazon S3 has pretty good guarantees on data consistency for example.\r\n\r\n### But I back up to CDs/DVDs\r\nArchiverify might still be useful. CDs/DVDs can and do rot. Archiverify's single directory mode can help you notice when a disc goes bad.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
