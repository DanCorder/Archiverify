# Hash file naming
This version of Archiverify changes the default name for the files that store hashes from hashes.txt to .hashes. The new name means that the files will be hidden by default on *nix systems. It also means that by default Archiverify v2.0.0 won't pick up hash file generated by v1.0.0. I apologise for any inconvenience but frankly I'd be surprised if this actually affects anyone other than me :) Either way it's best to get it out of the way early.

v2.0.0 adds the -f, -fr and -fw options that allow you to continue with archives already scanned with v1.0.0

## Migration from v1.0.0
To migrate an archive simply add the following option the next time you scan it "-fr hashes.txt". After the first time you won't need to use the option again. You can use this option in combination with single directory mode to rename the hash files under a single root too.

## Continue using hashes.txt
To continue using hashes.txt just add "-f hashes.txt" any time you use Archiverify

# Relative path support
This version includes a fix to work with root directories supplied as relative paths.
