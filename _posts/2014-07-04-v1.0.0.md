This version of Archiverify will:

* Compare two directory trees and:
  * Generate hashes for any files that don't have them
  * Read files and compare their calculated hashes against stored hashes
  * Warn you if a file doesn't match its hash or the equivalent file in the other tree
  * Overwrite a corrupted file if both stored hashes and the equivalent file in the other tree all match each other
  * Copy files and directories that are only in one tree into the other
* Scan a single directory tree and:
  * Generate hashes for any files that don't have them
  * Read files and compare their calculated hashes against stored hashes
  * Warn you if a file doesn't match its hash

Archiverify is written to be cross platform, but so far has only been tested on Windows. Feedback from other platforms would be useful.
