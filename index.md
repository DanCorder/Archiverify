# What does it do?
Archiverify takes two directories, recursively copies files between them, generates hashes for the files, and warns you if any existing files or hashes don't match.

# Why?
To make back-ups of unchanging data simple and reliable.

If you have a large number of files that don't change - for example your digital photos - then Archiverify allows you to easily compare your master copy with your back-ups and copy over any new files. It will also warn you if either copy of a file gets corrupted.

# But I back up to an online service
Then feel free to move right along. As long as your online service guarantees your back-ups won't get corrupted then Archiverify isn't for you. Amazon S3 has pretty good guarantees on data consistency for example.

#But I back up to CDs/DVDs
Archiverify might still be useful. CDs/DVDs can and do go bad. Archiverify's single directory mode can help you notice when a disc goes bad.
